####Publish
To publish with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), simply create a branch called `gh-pages`in your repository. GitHub will build your site automatically and publish it at `http://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname/`.  
If there are problems with loading assets like CSS files and images, make sure that the `baseurl` in the `_config.yml`is set correctly (it should say `/repositoryname`).

If you want to host your website somewhere else than GitHub (or just would like to customize and build your site locally), please check out the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/).
